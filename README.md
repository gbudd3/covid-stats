# covid-stats

This is a quick project to draw graphs of daily COVID-19 data at the state and county level (specially NJ and Morris County for my purposes)

The underlying data is from the New York Times via their https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data page)

The Population data from from the census bureau at these pages:

https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-total.html

There are other ways to go get that data should it be needed
